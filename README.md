Karpenter is an open-source node provisioning project built for Kubernetes.
Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:

* **Watching** for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable
* **Evaluating** scheduling constraints (resource requests, nodeselectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology spread constraints) requested by the pods
* **Provisioning** nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
* **Removing** the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed

Come discuss Karpenter in the [#karpenter](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02SFFZSA2K) channel, in the [Kubernetes slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) or join the [Karpenter working group](https://karpenter.sh/docs/contributing/working-group/) bi-weekly calls. If you want to contribute to the Karpenter project, please refer to the Karpenter docs.
